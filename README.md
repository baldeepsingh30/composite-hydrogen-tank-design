### ‚úÖ Additional Insight:

This ply-by-ply failure simulation of the carbon fiber/epoxy laminate confirms that the composite shell can **withstand internal pressures exceeding 700 bar**, as the **first ply failure occurs at approximately 918 MPa** of axial stress‚Äîwell above the design threshold.

To account for the **load-sharing with the aluminum liner**, a compensating equation was developed:

![Load Sharing Equation](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/c2/ql_b70fa99730189ddb90d2fb2e926413c2_l3.png)

Where:
- `œÉ_total`: Total internal pressure (converted to equivalent axial stress)
- `œÉ_aluminum`: Hoop stress taken by the aluminum liner
- `t_al`, `t_composite`, `t_total`: Thicknesses of aluminum, composite, and total wall

This formulation allowed for accurate estimation of the pressure **absorbed solely by the composite laminate**, validating its performance under realistic structural conditions.
